## About Me

My full name is Mohammad Parsa Toopchinezhad. I am a final year BSc student studying Computer Engineering at Razi University; experienced with research and teaching. Throughout my studies, I have primarily focused on Machine Learning (ML)--particularly Reinforcement Learning (RL)--which I have successfully applied to solve various simulated and real-world problems. Currently, I am working with my supervisor, [Dr.Ahmadi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nLI3EwoAAAAJ&hl=en), to develop adaptable ML agents for next-generation computer networks.
